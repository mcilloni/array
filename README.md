array
=====

A simple, minimalistic array selfresizing array structure in C. Just scapped bits from here and there, nothing special.

This has no purpose other than being useful and easy to use; this is just a part of a larger work and you should not have any expectations from this. 

See ex.c, slicex.c and strex.c for usage examples, Makefile is just a stub and expects jemalloc and clang.
